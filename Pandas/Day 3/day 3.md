## Day 3: Exploring Data with Pandas

### Introduction

On Day 3 of my data science journey on Kaggle, I delved deeper into data exploration using Pandas. In this notebook, I practiced various indexing, selecting, and assigning techniques to gain insights from a wine reviews dataset.

### Overview of the Dataset

I started by loading the wine reviews dataset and examining its structure.

### Exercises

1. **Selecting Specific Columns**: I selected the 'description' column from the dataset and explored its contents.
2. **Extracting Specific Values**: I extracted the first value from the 'description' column to understand its structure.
3. **Selecting Specific Rows**: I selected the first row of data to gain insights into individual records.
4. **Slicing Data**: I sliced the dataset to extract the first 10 values from the 'description' column.
5. **Filtering Records**: I filtered records based on specific index labels to focus on relevant data.
6. **Creating Custom DataFrame**: I created a DataFrame containing selected columns for specific records.
7. **Exploring Specific Columns**: I explored the country and variety columns of the first 100 records.
8. **Filtering Data**: I filtered the dataset to extract reviews of wines made in Italy.
9. **Advanced Filtering**: I extracted top-rated reviews (95 points or above) for wines from Australia or New Zealand.

Throughout these exercises, I honed my skills in data manipulation and learned valuable techniques for extracting meaningful insights from complex datasets. As I continue my journey, I look forward to applying these skills to real-world data analysis tasks.
